PS 1: Productivity App for Engineering Students (Frontend Only)

📌 Overview

Engineering students manage multiple academic responsibilities such as lectures, labs, assignments, projects, and exams. Most existing productivity tools are generic and not designed around academic workflows, leading to poor usability and low adoption.
This project focuses on building a frontend-only productivity web app specifically tailored for engineering students, with a clean UI, structured layouts, and academic-focused task management.
